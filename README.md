### To all of you ... 👋

Who may happen to read this, let me introduce myself. 

My name is **Shalien**, I'm a french IT tech and developper born in '93.
I started software dev on C and JAVA before taking classes in C# / SQL / PHP / JS

Today I mainly work in Dart / Flutter.

I also created  [Projetretro ⚙️](https://github.io/projetretro) a movement aimed to improve the present in all the possible way to make the future better.
